The in lab study has been developed with the following frameworks and languages for the frontend, middleware, and backend: 
1. HTML, CSS, Javascript, Typescript
2. AngularJS
3. Python Flask

In order to run the frontend, you need to "serve" the Angular application. To do this, cd to the inlab_study directory, then frontend, then angular-blossom-ts. Then run this commmand: "ng serve"

The port is usually localhost:4200. Either click that link in the command, or type it into your browser.
